todo:
    - vegetation pkg values might need tweaking
        swamp trees are kinda not distributed?

    - cleanup used heightmaps after time

    - fix mistlands mist distribution
        literally a blanket

    - fix zdo-specific world saving
        primarily related to object-specific saves apparently, like container, terrain modifier?...
   
    - calc server memory consumption
        zdos primarily...
        
    - test reducing world size to 313
        also add constraints when near edge of world
        so index bounds issues wont happen
   
    - implement portals
    
    - fix server shutdown routines
        - has hardly been worked on in months, very outdated and maybe unsafe or unimplemented, ie. 
            - save world, 
            - proper cleanup / disposal of managers
       
    - block WNT packets?
        cause particles to spawn on screen likely causing lagg if many 
        
    
    - consolidate all player notification messages into one method
        showMessage, chatMessage, RemotePrint...
    
    - use bitshift for Biome type (instead of mask)

    - send zdos more/less often/more depending on network load and per-client latency

    - modify RouteManager to not have so much peer indirection
        (stop with ints...)
    
    - option for setting zone area distance in config
        
    - optimize zdo padding more?
        experiment with member offsets...
        masks for bool types
        
    - idea for unloading/destroying/reconciliating inactive zdos in world:
        - if zdo is a once-visited type (rock, trees, basically exploratory), and hardly ever visited, could unload to disk if necessary for memory...
        
    - mods?
        compress
        
finished:
    - have method to get normal vector of heightmap at position
        consider using 4-pt normal for more acc normals if simple and fast enough
        
        but simple 2-pt normals work fine

    - world saving apparently broken (loading however is fully supported)
        was skipping utf-8 that had 3 total encoded byte sizes instead of the expected 2 -> 3 bytes

    - high priority: add full utf-8 char encoding and decoding for full Valheim c# compat
        current asystem is lazy and will only work with single bytes up to count 127, beyond that is special encoding...

    - restructure netpackage 
        - rename + make underlying stream use a ptr vec...
        - stream in many cases should be read only, like reading data incrementally, without copying when sub packages need making

    - prevent players spaces or non-ascii from joining
        or just invalid names
        or normalize the name (condense code points, dont just remove)

    - tweak vegetation rocks overlap radius
        perhaps too large, because black forest looks somewhat sparse compared to normal
    
    - work on vegetation overlap prevention

    - add option to immediately allow once-passworded users whove joined before
    - print a message to player on login whether auto logged in
        yes
    
    - locations appear to be offset by 1/2 of their width (along 1 axis), probably due to the way unity derives the final object position from instantiations in accordance with scale
    
    - check if ban command sends spaces
        it only sends the first split text...
        
    - try using Heightmap:: Biome and BiomeArea methods again, instead of geo (might be causing post-smoothing biome problems)
        it seems to have worked!

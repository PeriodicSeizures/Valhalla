## Overview
 - I have separated the different implementations of Valhalla into branches. 
 - The `main` branch is mainly informative based and my personal findings. 
 - The server is located in the `server` branch. 
 - The client is located on the `client` branch. It is no longer being maintained due to my technical limitations with graphical programming.
 - The `steamapi-example` branch is a minimal example of steam api. I made a feeble attempt with the steam api to host the server (like Valheim does), but I kept running into issues with the server requiring the Steam client to be already running (located on the `steam-gameserver` branch).

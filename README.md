# Valhalla 

## Server
Now compatible with the Steam Valheim client.

## Progress
10/24/2022 + TODO
 - Using Steam API now, clients can join without requiring any Patching. Lua bindings are minorly in progress.

 - Focus must be put into ZDO's and RoutedRPC stuff and game states. The login procedure was comparitively easy. Now it will get difficult.

10/8/2022 + TODO
 - I plan on adding ZDO reading for the server and sending ZDOs. I dont know yet what ZDO controls player visibilty to others on join. Also, some kind of world generation. Valheim terrain generation is client side, as in the client is given the seed, and it generates the terrain. The exception is manually modified terrain, like with a hoe/pickaxe/cultivator.
 
 - Also the client ZRpc occasionally experiences a timeout. I'm not sure why yet, because data is still sent fine between the client and server until the timeout disconenct.
    

10/7/2022 - The client can join and finally see the world, albeit is an ocean.

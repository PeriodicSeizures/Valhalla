# Valhalla 

## Server
Now compatible with the Steam Valheim client.

## Progress
10/24/2022 + TODO
 - Clients can now directly join without any patching. 
 
 - Limited Lua support. Lua Rpc/Routed/Sync callbacks will be prioritized next.

 - Must prioritize working on ZDO dispersement, ZNetView, and gameobjects.

 - UnityEngine Random and Mathf.PerlinNoise are required, both of which are in native code. Theres no likely solution besides reverse engineering the original algorithms or being provided equivalent if not native algorithms from Unity themselves.
 
 - All gameobjects in Valheim (especially character-like) are prefabs with predefined members and attributes (such as persistent...). No single component has a specialized class attached, its a one-works-for-all way of functionality (All entities have Humanoid class, which really simplifies the design, but many settings happen to be redundant with this design). 
 
 - So far (limiting to the Chair class), the Chair and other gameobjects when interacted client-side dont make same use of interact/hover/useitem on the server-side. The client at the lowest level sets a ZDO, which gets sent. The server sort of processes and relays this off to other clients.
 
 - The client has too much control over deciding who should be the target of ZNetView calls. This can be easily solved by gating each client->client call by checking if the call is meant to be sent, and is well formed. This is one of the goals of this project.

10/8/2022 + TODO
 - I plan on adding ZDO reading for the server and sending ZDOs. I dont know yet what ZDO controls player visibilty to others on join. Also, some kind of world generation. Valheim terrain generation is client side, as in the client is given the seed, and it generates the terrain. The exception is manually modified terrain, like with a hoe/pickaxe/cultivator.
 
 - Also the client ZRpc occasionally experiences a timeout. I'm not sure why yet, because data is still sent fine between the client and server until the timeout disconenct.
    

10/7/2022 - The client can join and finally see the world, albeit is an ocean.

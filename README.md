## Overview
I have separated the different implementations of Valhalla into branches. The main branch is mainly informative based and my personal findings. The client is located on the `client` branch. The server is located in the `server` branch. The client is no longer being developed due to my technical limitations with graphical programming. The `steamapi-example` branch is a minimal example of steam api. I made a feeble attempt in using the steam api to host the server (like Valheim does), but I kept running into issues with the server requiring the Steam client to be already running.

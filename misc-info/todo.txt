todo:
    - debug mode is slow    
        compression suffers especially, and is noticeable when many clients join and capture mode is active. This is expected but annoying

    - add a guaranteed unique world playback session selector (inc until no folder found)

    - put lua socket packet on send/recv capture in peer instead of SteamSocket

    - ideas for dynamic playback:
        support for:
            realtime changing playback speeds
            playback in reverse
            playback from set time points
            
        ways for rewinding playback might be possible by
        taking snapshots of world and its state at preset time
        so that fast-forwarding playback by 2 hours doesnt take forever to process
        
        because the current system takes into account ALL packets, and 
        not particularly how the way the world changes to the packets
        
        an example of this is the current lack of recording for:
            RandomEvents
            WorldTime
            ZDOs
            
        additionally the current system will need changes to 
        support the above, remarks:
            - activating a middle snapshot might have online peers
                need a way to add those peers anytime
                
        all of this might be unfeasable because the observing client keeps already-created zdoids in circulation until disconnect
        this breaks any rewinding capabilities
        
        a system like this would require some kind of nested zdo system within the primary manager, ie. sandboxing simulated zdos
        and creating new zdos with ever-increasing ids to correctly reflect created or destroyed objects client-side

    - navigate through handshake-rpcs, making sure things would go perfectly for a replaying client
    
        remove password restrictions
        
        must do some client renaming or something for replayed clients
            (assuming a client with same name and same host joins
                while a replay is happening...)
            that would be weird, so do something... frick

    - best alternate to world recording:
        record the world-as-is
        
        record all current online peers
        
        record Rpc from peer:
            record ZDOData
                
        record RoutedRpc from peer:
            record EVERYONE DamageText
            record EVERYONE DestroyZDO
            record EVERYONE SpawnObject
            record EVERYONE ChatMessage
            
            record EVERYONE NetView...
                important: ZSyncAnimation
                

    - take a snapshot of everything in the world
        capture every ZDO in world to set the precedent/base
        
        then record changes taking place
            zdo change/create/destroy
            znetview calls (via routed rpc)
                if target was everyone, record it
    
            later on:
                capture damagetext, setevent, spawnobject, chatmessage...
                
        think about this in the 3rd person:
            anything that an outside silent observer can capture should be 
            the baseline for determining what must be captured
            
        AN ALTERNATE APPROACH:
            capture every timestamped packet from every peer, then replay those 
            the packets will easily filter through the system of intended
            recipients and observers
            
            PROS:
                easy af to miplement, everything is captured verbatim, nothing missing
            
            CONS:
                everything is captured... including redundant non-changed information
                only con really is disk space
                
        so a fake Socket will be required
        probably a ReplaySocket that will
        send payloads at specified matching 
        relative times
         
         
         
    

    - packet capture and replays
        This will take up a lot of disk space over time. Capturing a simple 1 hours worth of data for every player and changed objects is hmmm
        
        ideas for reducing consumption:
            - ONLY track changes in ZDOs, not every single little thing
            
        there are 2 aspects to capturing:
            - capturing ZDOs to replay the world and events taking place over time.
                basically capturing objectschanging in game (will be the simplest and most straight-forward approach)
            - capturing "PACKETS" and replaying from there
                this will capture EVERYTHING that EVERY player does. This includes rpc calls, 
                
        must capture every ZNetView routed method call aimed towards @EVERYONE
        capture every ZDO creation/change/destroy of Rpc::ZDOData and Route::DestroyZDO
        

    - server-side player inventories and metering
        player defaultingly spawns in with nothing (except for rag cloth)
        
        if player is new, treat inventory as empty
        
        only definite way to add/remove items from inventory:
            - ItemDrop::Pickup (causes zdo erase)
            - ItemDrop::Drop (causes zdo instantiate)
            - Inventory::MoveItemToThisContainer -> Container::OnContainerChanged triggers a ZDO save
            - Crafting (a bit is unknown about this on client side, no way to validate?)

    - minor memory leaks (these are more like ignored object leaks, not forgotton ptrs)
        - Peer.m_zdos
            old ZDOs that are no longer near the player persist in this container until the peer quits
        - HeightmapManager heightmaps
            newly generated zones utilize Heightmaps in order to generate features/foliage, and these Heightmaps persist until the server stops

    - leviathans sinking when leaving area
        probably something to do with server needing to do something with them
        
        possible ideas:
            if leviathan not at y=0 prior to peer leaving, consider setting height to 40 or something to prevent peer from fucking up everything
            
            hopefully this causes peer to only lower the leviathan down towards the surface instead of down to bedrock

    - fix dungeon netview orientations
        some netviews in DG_Cave (crystal in this small corrider) and the roots when entering crypt are either floating or in the way. 
        
        seemingly another root in a different crypt is fine... (i think it has to do with not applying correct rotations) I bet this is the issue because crypt mud piles are misaligned in a room (too much to the side in start room)
        


    - inventory equippable pickable items will have icons:
        ItemDrop.m_itemData.m_shared.m_icons wont be empty if the item is legal
    
    - legal zdo spawning / tracking (illegal item / object spawning mitigation)
        basically prevent players from spawning the un-grabbable draugr axe etc...
        these weird items exist so that npc / characters are able to display them and use stats due to the way the game was made. The player however is not allowed to use them for obvious reasons. Will gid deeper to find what makes the player able to pick up or unable to pickup certain items, and will use that to base the legal item filter against
        
        can easily implement zdo searcher to see who spawns in certain zdos, who modified which zdos at whichever time, maybe even a replay tool? would be interesting, kinda reminds me of using wireshark to log packets. Basically replay the client conversation to the server visa-versa.      

    - boat-lagg fix (important or not?)
        when a player (owner) temporarily stops sending packets, the boat will be much ahead, causing other players to be in the previous position.
        a possible idea would be to identify any instantaneous change in position, not impulse or integral velocity (since position in this sense is a simple sudden change due to lagg spike)
        
        could try resetting player-owner, setting position, then setting owner back (hmm, must experiment because this abuses the particular code of ZSyncTransform--- I am not sure how the client might respond to this). This must be carried out over several frames, not all at once...
        
        Player.Teleport does work, but it is a whole slow sequence. It does not actually teleport the player instantaneously because it is meant for slow loading areas from long distance portal travels. The above ZSyncTransform idea is the best bet at something to tp the player instantaneousy, but possibly finicky and buggy. must test...

    - fix server shutdown routines
        - has hardly been worked on in months, very outdated and maybe unsafe or unimplemented, ie. 
            - save world, 
            - proper cleanup / disposal of managers
   
    - the below priority will require NetView method capture, abstraction and high performance code will be c++, with the extensions and behaviour in lua.
    
    - ZDO restore / reconciliation to prevent illegal modification by malicious clients
        
    - ZDO based item assign 
        Container::RPC_TakeAllRespons
            appears to insert all items in inventory to local player
        - Player death causes entire inventory to be moved to tombstone
            this is clientside, as usual
        - detect events via incoming updated zdos
    
    - fix mistlands mist distribution
        literally a blanket
        possibly vegetation mask broken?
        is vegetation being correctly skipped or placed as needed?

    - cleanup used heightmaps after time
        or could generate everything
          
    - calc server memory consumption
        zdos primarily...
        estimated based on sizeof(ZDO) and number of zdos
            not entirely accurate because zdos themselves allocate memory,
       
    - vegetation pkg values might need tweaking
        swamp trees are kinda not distributed?
        
    - block WNT packets?
        cause particles to spawn on screen likely causing lagg if many 
    
    - send zdos more/less often/more depending on network load and per-client latency
    
    - use bitshift for Biome type (instead of mask)

    - modify RouteManager to not have so much peer indirection
        (stop with ints...)
    
    - option for setting zone area distance in config
        
    - optimize zdo padding more?
        experiment with member offsets...
        masks for bool types
        
    - idea for unloading/destroying/reconciliating inactive zdos in world:
        - if zdo is a once-visited type (rock, trees, basically exploratory), and hardly ever visited, could unload to disk if necessary for memory...
        
finished:
    - GoblinCamp2 - very crammed
        fixed

    - fix dungeon generation
        either go back to using mild accuracy rotated rect detection
        OR
        use normalized grid room overlap detection, where each room takes up nodes,
        and has max size:
            since im assuming each room has a normalized/unit size, find this out, then create a grid of nodes equal to 64/UNIT (where unit is the smallest square room). Collision detection will just be detecting whether a grid is occupied
            
            what about end caps? they might be emall and weirdly sized, so im not sure about this method
            
            another method could be to just stop using complex rotated rectangle collision, since im having insane troubles with that. INSTEAD, use regular rectangle collision with a normalized rotation grid, then apply all rotation to rooms after its done.
            
            Either way, I cant continue making so many features that already exist in unity. I thought this would be simple, but the method the devs use is not so simple. I will find a way around this.

    - change room netviews instantiate transforms to correctly reflect new pkg transform write (most local)
    
        also observe any usages of templated room.position (not instanced) or localPos or rotation for significance in keeping?
        
    - dungeons currently being worked on

    - fix general-Valheim latency issues (regarding client-side processing)
        theres no real good fix to this without changing the core networking and mechanics of the game
        
        Possible solutions:
            - reassign zdos to the nearest player 
            - reassign zdos radially to players, except in overlaps
            
        Biggest caveats/important aspects/most frequent annoyances:
            - COMBAT (Parrying especially) / Pickable/PickableItem under another zone-client is annoying, and most always laggy,
                so, likely reassign owners during these situations:
                    combat might be partially fixed by reassigning to the nearest player, only when players are fa apart from each other, and depends on distance of zdo-enemy in question

    - trying to get a way to represent zdo-components (members) without convoluting everything
        - each gameobject has only 1 zdo, therefore each zdo can refer to 1 gameobject, along with its properties (or more statically, its prefab capabilities):
        - whether the object is a:
            - Piece (Buildable/Placeable by player)
            - ItemDrop (Dropped Ground Item)
            - CraftingStation
            - WearNTear (Structural support / durability)
            - Pickable (Seasoning vegetation / goblin totem poles / Respawnable stuff)
            - DropOnDestroyed (destroyed objects drop)
            - CharacterDrop (killed entities drop)
            - Humanoid
            - MonsterAI

    - Use 64bit hash for ZDO map (mutated-only) so that collisions become nearly impossible

    - Container::inUse wrongly named zdo hash
        typo

    - fix zdos on save:
        chests Resetting
        Terrain Resetting
        Rocks Resetting
        Wards disabling
        Signs Resetting
        Fermenter Resetting
        Beds Resetting
        
        - ZDO save -> write issue fixed

    - consolidate all player notification messages into one method
        single useful Message(msg, type)

    - mod event error handler
        mod callback disabled if any error

    - fix log file backups
        compressed to /logs

    - test whether players work right near edge of world, or zdos...
        vegetation is not placed near edge of world, this might be why
        
        instead of square zone checks, check radially (within bounds of circular world)
        
    - test reducing world size to 313
        also add constraints when near edge of world
        so index bounds issues wont happen

    - implement quaternion euler fully
    
    - implement quaternion lookdirection fully
        so that prefabs are rotated correctly on worldgen
        broken in cases where an axis is zero or near zero

    - implement portals
        portals now link together with the help of a lua mod 
        
    - mods?
        comfy compress mod implemented

    - have method to get normal vector of heightmap at position
        consider using 4-pt normal for more acc normals if simple and fast enough
        
        but simple 2-pt normals work fine

    - world saving apparently broken (loading however is fully supported)
        was skipping utf-8 that had 3 total encoded byte sizes instead of the expected 2 -> 3 bytes

    - high priority: add full utf-8 char encoding and decoding for full Valheim c# compat
        current asystem is lazy and will only work with single bytes up to count 127, beyond that is special encoding...

    - restructure netpackage 
        - rename + make underlying stream use a ptr vec...
        - stream in many cases should be read only, like reading data incrementally, without copying when sub packages need making

    - prevent players spaces or non-ascii from joining
        or just invalid names
        or normalize the name (condense code points, dont just remove)

    - tweak vegetation rocks overlap radius
        perhaps too large, because black forest looks somewhat sparse compared to normal
    
    - work on vegetation overlap prevention

    - add option to immediately allow once-passworded users whove joined before
    - print a message to player on login whether auto logged in
        yes
    
    - locations appear to be offset by 1/2 of their width (along 1 axis), probably due to the way unity derives the final object position from instantiations in accordance with scale
    
    - check if ban command sends spaces
        it only sends the first split text...
        
    - try using Heightmap:: Biome and BiomeArea methods again, instead of geo (might be causing post-smoothing biome problems)
        it seems to have worked!

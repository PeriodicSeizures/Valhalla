valheim (or any other game) Packet analysis using Wireshark (not live)

Valheim utilizes Steam for underlying game data transport (proprietary and closed source). Their custom UDP protocol is encrypted and inaccessible outside of the intended application.

For these reasons, I have captured several game packets (from within the application). These packets are decrypted, and able to be read as-is without any network reassembly.

To view these packets in Wireshark, you will have to do a few things.

First, you will need ncat.

Start an ncat server to listen on port 2456 (TCP is default)
    ncat -l 2456
    
This will listen until a packet is received (this works fine for now while trying to get the Lua dissector to work).

Open Wireshark and start listening on your Loopback traffic capture adapter.

Now send the packet to the server
    ncat --send-only 127.0.0.1 2456 < mypacket.pkg
    
On Windows Powershell this might not work. Instead I decided to use Git Bash (was installed along with Git Desktop). This works good enough as it is a linux environment that supports piping/redirection.
